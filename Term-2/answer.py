            "Although the word engineer always arouses a sense of pride and it's worth being an engineer, many people still lack a deeper understanding of what engineering is from a historical point of view. Engineering is a stream of science that has helped humans shape the world and will continue to do so. As the author tells us, engineering is the application of science to solve real-word problems, and engineers, as practitioners of engineering, are problem solvers who use their expertise in science. As we trace back in time, we can easily see the influences of engineers, past and present, on the world we are living in. Engineers are the special spectrum of people who take delight in creating order from disorder and move the world forward.Engineering is a broad field that is divided into various disciplines and sub-disciplines, but there exist only six main categories: mechanical engineering, civil engineering, chemical engineering, petroleum engineering, electrical/electronic engineering, and aerospace engineering. Engineers differ from scientists in that they create that which has never been, while scientists investigate that which already is. However, both scientists and engineers complement each other and make contributions to our society. Although engineering is a great field to get into, an engineering career might not be a good fit for everyone."]],

First of all, the investment in XR is rapidly increasing in different areas and sectors, and has no signs of stopping, indicating that immersive technologies will be prevalent in the future and result in more applications. Companies that don’t want to get left behind should start to use XR in ways that best suit their business needs. Second, XR has many case applications. For example, XR is highly applicable to workforce development, employee training, and consumer-facing industries such as e-commerce. XR can offer a wide range of possibilities in every aspect of life and in an ongoing way. Third, a younger and tech-savvy workforce demands cutting-edge technologies such as XR as millennials begin to dominate the workforce. The adoption of XR technology could benefit workplaces in the long term. To sum up, XR is coming. It is a good time for forward-thinking executives to consider entertaining the XR technology."]],

In the retail industry, the extremely fast data speeds will enhance the mobile shopping experience, and develop innovative ways of customer engagement that incorporate AR/VR technologies. In the financial services, 5G could accelerate a number of mobile operations and assist in real-time data transmission. In the media and entertainment industry, 5G revolutionizes many areas via the exponential increase in the download speed and unprecedented virtual consumption experience. In the healthcare industry, not only will 5G be capable of handling the massive data load, but it will also facilitate the remote monitoring devices and remote surgery procedures. In the transportation industry, 5G offers new insights into smart transportation systems such as V2V and V2I communications. In the education industry, 5G has the potential to transform traditional educational methods and enrich classroom learning experience by leveraging AR/VR technologies particularly in high-risk educational settings. In the cloud computing, 5G’s low latency and high throughput could improve cloud computing experience. In the public safety industry, 5G could enhance public safety capabilities thereby improving emergency response and information sharing."]],

In such fields as mobility as a service, sustainable travel behavior, traffic management, traffic congestion and micromobility management, European companies design and launch state-of-the-art products to help improve mobility with the latest advance in technologies.

With the power of computing tools, computers have become more than just manufacturing tools, but have evolved into indispensable thinking tools. With their unique logic, computers can solve more and more human problems. The main difference between the way we think and the way computers solve problems is that our brain was never hard-wired for big data. When dealing with too many facts and data, we have to compress them into shorter notations or adopt the method of classification. It may lead to the loss of information in the process. Compared with humans, computers are superior in computation and data processing and they can search without sorting. Because of these properties, in the field of architecture, computers can notate every brick of a building and micro-design each minute particle of a building, which may save plenty of building material, energy, labor and money and can deliver buildings that are better fit to spec. Although computers have advantages over humans in big data, no machine-learning system can optimize all parameters of a design process in the meantime, only designers can.

Each building is networked to the eaves and embedded within City Intelligent Platforms, which are used to process vast volumes of data from sensor networks. All the information constitutes a virtual digital ecosystem that administers itself. Meanwhile, the building has become a high-performance energy supplier. People can store energy from the solar panels on the fa?ade and wind generators on the roof. As global networking expanded, people could do almost everything at home. While this reduces emissions, it makes people lonely and unhappy. The advent of holographic studio solves the problem. It helps people to meet and eat in the virtual space. In addition, self-service system is everywhere. For example, when the ingredients for a cake in the bakery are out of stock, the autonomous supply vehicle can fill up itself without receiving instructions.
